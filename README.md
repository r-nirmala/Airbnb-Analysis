## Airbnb-Analysis
The objectives of this project is to analyse and visualize Airbnb data to learn more about pricing variations, booking trends, and location-based trends. This project employs MongoDB Atlas, Streamlit, and Plotly data visualization technique to provide an in-depth analysis.

### Technologies Used:

Python

Pandas

MongoDB

MySQL

Streamlit

Plotly

Tableau

### Approach: 
1. Data Retrieval: Retrieve the Airbnb dataset from MongoDB or other sources.
2. Data Cleaning and Preparation: Cleaning the Airbnb dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming data types as necessary. Preparing the dataset for EDA and visualization tasks.
3. Geospatial Visualization: Developing a streamlit web application that utilizes the geospatial data from the Airbnb dataset to create interactive maps. 
4. Price Analysis and Visualization: Using the cleaned data to analyze and visualize how prices vary across different locations, property types, and seasons. Creating dynamic plots and charts that enable users to explore price trends.
5. Location-Based Insights: Investigation of how the price of listings varies across different locations. Visualized these insights on interactive maps.
6. Interactive Visualizations: Developed dynamic and interactive visualizations which allow users to filter and drill down into the data based on their preferences. Enable users to interact with the visualizations to explore specific regions, property types, or time periods of interest.
7. Dashboard Creation: Utilized Tableau to create a comprehensive dashboard that presents key insights from the analysis. Combined different visualizations, such as maps, charts, and tables, to provide a holistic view of the Airbnb dataset and its patterns.
